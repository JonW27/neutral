            <h1>Definition of Net Neutrality</h1>

            </div>
            <p>Net Neutrality was first coined by Columbia professor Tim Wu in his paper <i>Network Neutrality, Broadband Discrimination</i> in the year 2002. In this paper, he defined net neutrality as "an Internet that does not favor one appliction over others"(Wu 5). He argues that the FCC should regulate the Internet as an open-access utility, instead of allowing ISPs to self-regulate, which would allow ISPs to charge different amounts of money for different website loading speeds. In the early days of the Internet, the Internet was ultimately controlled by cable companies with their modems. However, as the Internet became much more widespread, the argument about whether it should be a utility has become more widespread.</p>

            <h1>Impact</h1>
            <p>The net neutrality controversy has an impact on the majority of the first-world given the relative abundance of people with Internet access. Over 50% of people use the web to browse a set 30 sites. If companies are allowed to charge different prices for speeds to different websites it ultimately enfranchises those in power over say a Stuyvesant startup. For example, an ISP can have different packages of which the faster speed is more easily paid by an enormous enterprise such as Google, leaving the small business competitor behind. Research has shown that speed delays of over 250ms has led to over 50% of participants ultimately not visiting the site. ISPs can also demand money from alternatives to in-house options. The most notable example of this is that of Netflix who had a rife with Comcast. This is an example of zero rating, a practice by which an ISP has practices that give selective advantages to its own products over those of potential Internet competitors.
