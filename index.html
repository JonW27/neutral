            <h1>Definition of Net Neutrality</h1>
            <div>
            </div>
            <p>Net Neutrality was first coined by Columbia professor Tim Wu in his paper <i>Network Neutrality, Broadband Discrimination</i> in the year 2002. In this paper, he defined net neutrality as "an Internet that does not favor one appliction over others"(Wu 5). He argues that the FCC should regulate the Internet as an open-access utility, instead of allowing ISPs to self-regulate, which would allow ISPs to charge different amounts of money for different website loading speeds. In the early days of the Internet, the Internet was ultimately controlled by cable companies with their modems. However, as the Internet became much more widespread, the argument about whether it should be a utility has become more widespread.</p>

            <h1>Impact</h1>
            <p>The net neutrality controversy has an impact on the majority of the first-world given the relative abundance of people with Internet access. Over 50% of people use the web to browse a set 30 sites. If companies are allowed to charge different prices for speeds to different websites it ultimately enfranchises those in power over say a Stuyvesant startup. For example, an ISP can have different packages of which the faster speed is more easily paid by an enormous enterprise such as Google, leaving the small business competitor behind. Research has shown that speed delays of over 250ms has led to over 50% of participants ultimately not visiting the site. ISPs can also demand money from alternatives to in-house options. The most notable example of this is that of Netflix who had a rife with Comcast. This is an example of zero rating, a practice by which an ISP has practices that give selective advantages to its own products over those of potential Internet competitors.

            <h1>Historical Context</h1>
            <p>According to Tim Wu's book, <i>The Master Switch– The Rise and Fall of Information Empires</i>, there is context for this debate about net neutrality. Wu points out that there is a certain cycle with technology: it is first invented–</p><ol>
            <li>hobbyists tinker with it</li>
            <li>it starts to catch on and become more mainstream</li>
            <li>corporations begin offering it, creating advances and competition</li>
            <li>Some corporations begin buying others.</li>
            <li>Eventually monopolies are formed.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Wu uses the TV and radio as evidence, pointing out how the major broadcast networks: that of ABC, CBS, NBC, and FOX ultimately dominate with the consolidation of power, and how radio has also developed along similar lines with Sirium/XM and iHeartMedia (formerly known as clear channel).</p>

            <h1>This is still ongoing</h1>
            <p>After last year's election, the U.S. had a change in presidencies. This president appointed a new FCC commissioner, Ajit Pai, a former Verizon lawyer. After last year, where former FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler advocated stronger net neutrality laws, Pai proposes deregulation for the advance of industry. This is in a 75 page resoltion, titled <i>Restoring Internet Freedom</i>. As this is current, the FCC is allowing people to express their comments regarding this issue. To do so, follow the following steps.</p>
